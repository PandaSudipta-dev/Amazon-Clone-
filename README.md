# Amazon-Clone-
    The Amazon Clone is a static, responsive web page built using HTML5 and
 CSS3, designed to closely replicate the layout and user interface of the
 Amazon homepage. This project features a custom navigation bar with a
 logo, search bar, and cart icon, along with a responsive product grid
 showcasing various items with hover effects. It also includes a detailed
 footer section with mimicking the structure of a real e-commerce site. The
 primary goal of the project was to enhance front-end development skills by
 focusing on layout design, responsive styling, and semantic HTML.
